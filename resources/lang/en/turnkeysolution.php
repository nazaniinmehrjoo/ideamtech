    The brick complete production line in this factory uses advanced machineries and automated upgraded systems to produce high-quality bricks. The production phases include selecting and preparing raw materials, forming & shaping, drying the bricks, and finally baking them in industrial furnaces. Each phase is carefully controlled to ensure the final product meets the required standards. This process is continuously improved to enhance quality while decreasing energy consumption and reducing production time. The produced bricks are then prepared for use in construction projects, especially for facades and walls.',
